v1.0: basic version, passed general test	1/14
v1.1: add rear to list
      modify insert, removeNode, requestNewspace
      add function appendNode
      when allocate new block of space, append the space to the rear of list, instead search and insert
v1.2: TA: no need to consider invalid input
      change freeNode
      findInList deprecated
      fix valgrind errors general test (void *)
      more abstraction
v1.3: fix the bug of same block appering in 2 lists
      literally pass alloc test, but performance is so bad
v1.31: basically same as v1.3, changed a bit
